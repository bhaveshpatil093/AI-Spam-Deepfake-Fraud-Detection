# AI-Powered Fraud Detection System

## Overview
This project develops an AI-powered solution to detect and prevent spam calls, deepfake fraud, and VKYC exploitation in financial services. By leveraging AWS services, the system identifies suspicious activities in real-time through analysis of call metadata, behavioral patterns, and transaction data. Users are alerted instantly, enhancing trust and security in digital communication systems.

---

## Features
- **Spam Call Detection**: Converts call audio to text using AWS Transcribe and analyzes metadata and transcripts for fraud indicators.
- **Deepfake Detection in VKYC**: Uses Amazon Rekognition and machine learning models in Amazon SageMaker to identify facial and voice anomalies.
- **Financial Fraud Detection**: Monitors transaction data using AWS Glue and SageMaker to detect suspicious activities.
- **Real-Time Alerts**: Sends immediate notifications to users via Amazon SNS when potential threats are detected.
- **User Feedback Loop**: Gathers user reports through a UI and incorporates feedback into system updates.

---

## Impact
This solution has the potential to significantly reduce financial fraud and enhance user trust in digital communication systems. It:
- Protects vulnerable communities from scams and fraudulent activities.
- Promotes financial security and stability, especially in regions prone to such scams.
- Contributes to a safer and more trustworthy financial ecosystem.

---

## Uniqueness
What sets this project apart:
- **Comprehensive Approach**: Tackles multiple aspects of financial fraud—spam detection, deepfake analysis, and transaction monitoring—in one solution.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Provides real-time detection and alerts to minimize potential harm.
- **Scalability and Reliability**: Built on AWS services, ensuring robustness in high-volume environments.
- **Holistic Solution**: Combines advanced AI technologies and machine learning for an all-in-one fraud detection system.

1. **Data Ingestion**: 
   - Calls and VKYC session data uploaded to Amazon S3.
   - Transaction data ingested via AWS Glue.

2. **Processing**:
   - AWS Lambda functions analyze data for spam detection, deepfake analysis, and fraud detection.
   - Amazon SageMaker trains models for facial and voice anomaly detection.
   
3. **Alerts and Feedback**:
   - Suspicious activities trigger alerts via Amazon SNS.
   - Users provide feedback through a UI built with AWS Amplify.

- Trigger real-time Lambda functions for metadata analysis.

### **3. Deepfake Detection in VKYC**
- Use Rekognition for facial analysis.
- Train SageMaker models to detect anomalies in facial features and voice patterns.

### **4. Financial Fraud Detection**
- Analyze transaction patterns using Glue and SageMaker anomaly detection algorithms.

### **5. Real-Time Alerts**
- Set up Amazon SNS for instant notifications.
- Develop a user interface with AWS Amplify to report and respond to threats.
